            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-200">
              Our founding team, software developers by trade, have spent many
              years working hard to change the gender imbalance in tech:
              promoting tech as a desirable career to girls and young women, and
              teaching girls and women to code to bring them into the industry.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-400">
              After several years, they noticed that the women they had worked
              so hard to bring in were not being promoted at the same speed or
              frequency as their male peers, and did not feel they belonged.
              This was causing them to leave the industry again soon after.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-600">
              Tech Leading Ladies was started in 2017 as a small coaching group
              designed to break down the barriers to promotion for women in
              technology, giving its participants the tools and knowledge to
              overcome self-limiting behaviours and systemic bias in their jobs.
              We quickly moved to an online monthly Meetup format to help a
              wider audience.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-800">
              Since then we have grown into a community drawing members from
              across Australia and New Zealand.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-800">
              Our Slack group provides the networking, coaching and mentoring
              women often miss out on in their organisations. It gives
              visibility of role-models, successful female leaders in tech,
              paving the way for other women and showing them what they too can
              accomplish.
            </p>

            <p className="animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-800">
              Our Meetups bring content, resources and skills needed to succeed
              as a technical leader. Most of our speakers come from the TLL
              community.
